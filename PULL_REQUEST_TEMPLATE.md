# Pull Request Template

Hey there,

Thank you for contribution and walking with crea8lab in this awesome journey. Here are a few tips to help you make successful PRs 

- Update your local copy after you've committed your changes. 
- If any conflicts, resolve them accordingly.
- Take screenshots of your display... _how does what you've done look in the browser?_
- Go to your github account and send a PR from there with the screenshot attached to it.

Happy hacking
